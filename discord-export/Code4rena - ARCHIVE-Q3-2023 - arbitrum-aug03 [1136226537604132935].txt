Hey Im new to the audit world, Im just curious about the time given for this audit. I find 7 days might be little time, but as I said im pretty new so I wonder what you guy think of it,


[08/04/2023 12:56] berlin.101
Time is pretty fair considering the lines of code. There have been contests for 10000+ lines of code for 4 weeks. Considering that 1 week for this one is fair. For someone who can only dedicate a few hours/day and is new to auditing this may be not enough to cover everything. Strategy then could be to focus on just a selection of contracts/a particular aspect/module of the whole codebase in focus. Good luck @carlos__alegre 🙏

[08/05/2023 11:22] 0xprinc
Threshold is the number of signatures required to execute. 
So it should be smaller than the member count in security council.

Am i right ?


[08/05/2023 12:31] 0xnirlin
Yes it is probably 9 out of 12, but i saw 7 out of 12 too but prolly that is outdated


[08/05/2023 13:16] m_rassska
9/12 for mainnet, anyways, check out this one:

Also, NonGovernanceChainSCMgmtActivationAction this contract will be kept on a standby in case of emergency?


[08/06/2023 14:53] yahgwai
This contract is for activating the election system on Arbitrum Nova. It's called 'NonGovernance' as Nova is an Arbitrum chain, but not the one where governance occurs (Arbitrum One)

@gzeon , I dm you


[08/08/2023 09:50] paulbirnbaum
In the SecurityCouncilManager.sol Contract. There is a external call that I can get my head around.


[08/08/2023 09:54] paulbirnbaum
Indeed, in the "_scheduleUpdate" function, it call :
```ArbitrumTimelock(l2CoreGovTimelock).schedule({...})```

To get the contest, l2CoreGovTimelock is an Address
And ArbitrumTimeLock is a contract (not an Interface) that inherit from TimelockControllerUpgradeable.sol from OZ.
 
I've checked and the "l2CoreGovTimelock" isn't an argument of the schedule function.

I wonder what is that "l2CoreGovTimelock".

Thanks


[08/08/2023 10:37] gzeon
l2CoreGovTimelock is set during initialization to the timelock of the Arbitrum Dao core governor
you can also find the address here

wanted to share the audit report Trail of Bits did of the same election system https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-security-council-elections-proposed-implementation-spec/15425/10

the issues described there have been patched in the version yall are looking at, but thought it could still serve as interesting documentation
